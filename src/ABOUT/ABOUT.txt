This program was written for Data Mining Fall 2024.
It is our semester project.
The application is designed to use two different kinds
of regression to predict exam performance based on
student life factors which bear a high weight on the
student's eventual performance.
Lasso, ridge, and polynomial regression are all
implemented as part of this project. See our full 
report for more details.
